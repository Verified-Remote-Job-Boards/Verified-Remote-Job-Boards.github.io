                <h2>Overview and First Impressions</h2>
                <p>We Work Remotely (WWR) is a veteran in the remote job space, having been around since 2011. It boasts a massive following and is often the first place companies go to post remote-only positions. The site is clean, straightforward, and focuses purely on job listings without the clutter of excessive articles or side features. Its reputation is built on volume and a strong presence in the tech sector, making it a reliable source for developers, designers, and customer support professionals.</p>
                <p>While the sheer number of listings is impressive, job seekers should be prepared to filter through a high volume of applications, as competition can be fierce. The quality control is generally good, but it doesn't offer the same level of pre-vetting as some newer, more niche boards.</p>

It took about a month of consistent searching, but the quality of the companies posting there is top-notch. I appreciated that every job was genuinely remote, no hybrid nonsense. Definitely worth checking daily if you're serious about a tech role.</p>

                        <p class="review-text">It's a decent board, but I found the sheer volume of applicants made it tough to get noticed. I applied to about 20 jobs and only heard back from two. The listings are good, but it feels like a race to the bottom sometimes. I'm trying a few smaller, niche boards now to see if the competition is lower.</p>

                        <p class="review-text">Solid platform. The interface is super clean, which I love. No annoying ads or pop-ups. My only complaint is that the filtering for non-tech roles is pretty weak. I'm in digital marketing, and I had to scroll through a lot of engineering jobs to find relevant ones. Still, it's a must-visit for remote work.</p>

                        <p class="review-text">Best remote job board, hands down. I've used others, but WWR consistently has the most legitimate and high-paying roles. I found my last two remote positions here. The $299 posting fee seems to filter out the low-effort or scammy companies, which is a huge plus for job seekers.</p>

                        <p class="review-text">I was a bit disappointed. I'm looking for a remote role in HR, and there were barely any listings compared to the tech categories. It's clearly geared towards developers. If you're not in software, you might have better luck elsewhere. The site itself is fine, but the job diversity is lacking for my field.</p>
