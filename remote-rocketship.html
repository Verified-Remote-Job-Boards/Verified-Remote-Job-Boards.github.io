  <p class="review-text">I was skeptical at first, but Remote Rocketship really delivered. I spent about two weeks applying through their platform and landed an interview for a Senior Dev role that I'm genuinely excited about. The listings are high-quality and don't feel like they're just scraped from elsewhere. Definitely worth checking out if you're serious about finding a remote role.</p>

  <p class="review-text">It's a decent job board, but nothing revolutionary. I found a few interesting roles, but the volume of listings felt a bit low compared to the big general job sites. The filtering is good, though, and I appreciate that they verify the remote status. It's a good supplementary tool, but I wouldn't rely on it as my only source.</p>

  <p class="review-text">Honestly, I was pretty disappointed. I paid for the premium access hoping for exclusive listings, but most of what I saw I had already found on LinkedIn or Indeed. I sent out about 15 applications and got zero responses. Maybe it's just my industry (marketing), but it didn't work for me. I canceled my subscription after a month.</p>

  <p class="review-text">Solid platform. The interface is clean and easy to navigate. I like the feature that shows the estimated salary range right on the listing. I haven't landed a job yet, but I'm getting more relevant results here than anywhere else. Dropped one star because the mobile experience could be a little smoother.</p>

  <p class="review-text">Remote Rocketship is okay. It has a good selection of tech jobs, but not much for non-technical roles. I'm looking for a remote HR position and the listings were sparse. The site is fast and looks professional, but the content needs to be broader to justify the price.</p>
