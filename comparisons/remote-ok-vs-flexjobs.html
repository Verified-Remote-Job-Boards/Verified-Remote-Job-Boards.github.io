                        <p class="review-text">The sheer volume of jobs is impressive, but sometimes the 'remote' tag is a bit misleading, requiring you to be in a specific state or region. It's not a huge issue, but you have to read the fine print on a lot of the listings.</p>

                <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
                <p>The choice between Remote OK and FlexJobs comes down to your career field and budget.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Choose Remote OK if:</strong> You are in a technical role (developer, designer, product manager), you are looking for international or digital nomad opportunities, and you prefer a free service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose FlexJobs if:</strong> You are looking for a non-technical role (customer service, finance, healthcare), you value highly-vetted, scam-free listings, and you are willing to pay a small subscription fee for quality and variety.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many job seekers use both platforms to maximize their reach, focusing on Remote OK for tech roles and FlexJobs for broader industry searches.</p>
