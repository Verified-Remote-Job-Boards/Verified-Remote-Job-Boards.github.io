                    <p class="review-text">It's a good site, but it's hard to break in. I'm looking for an entry-level marketing position and most of the jobs require 3+ years of experience. I check it daily, but I'm finding more relevant roles on smaller, niche boards. The quality is there, just not the volume for my experience level.</p>

For $300, I expected a lot more visibility. The site looks great, but the traffic seems to be mostly passive browsers, not active applicants.</p>
