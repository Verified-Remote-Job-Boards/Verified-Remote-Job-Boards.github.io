  <p class="review-text">I was skeptical at first, but the quality of the job listings here is genuinely impressive. I've been using it for a month and already have three interviews lined up. It's a huge time-saver compared to endlessly scrolling through general job sites.</p>

  <div class="star-rating">★★★★☆</div>
  <p class="review-text">The platform is clean and easy to navigate. Found my current remote gig through them. The only minor thing is sometimes the filters could be a bit more granular, but overall, a fantastic resource.</p>
