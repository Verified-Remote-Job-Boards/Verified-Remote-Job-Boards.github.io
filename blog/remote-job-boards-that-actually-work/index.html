Free-to-post boards have more ghost jobs because there's no cost to leaving listings up. Employer-paid boards like We Work Remotely and curated boards like FlexJobs have fewer ghost jobs because maintaining fake listings costs money."

More than 5 boards creates diminishing returns and scattered effort. Set up alerts on your chosen platforms rather than manually checking dozens of sites.

FlexJobs curates entry-level opportunities with verified employers. Customer service, sales, and support roles offer the most accessible entry points. Tech and professional roles are harder to land remotely without experience. For entry-level success: apply quickly (within 48 hours of posting), customize every application, and consider starting with hybrid or contract roles to build remote experience."

                <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1f2937;">Quick Answer</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>The remote job boards that consistently get people hired are LinkedIn (volume and networking), We Work Remotely (curated tech/professional roles), Indeed (broad industry coverage), FlexJobs (verified listings), Remote OK (remote-first focus), and Wellfound (startups).</strong> No single board works for everyone—tech workers thrive on We Work Remotely while customer service candidates do better on Indeed and FlexJobs. Use 3-4 platforms strategically: one for volume, one curated for quality, and one matched to your industry.</p>

            <p>The internet is littered with "best remote job boards" lists that read like sponsored content—every platform sounds amazing, none have flaws, and you're left no closer to knowing where to actually spend your time. This guide takes a different approach: we're focused on which boards produce results, meaning actual interviews and job offers, not just pretty interfaces.</p>

            <p>A board "works" when it connects you with legitimate opportunities that match your skills and leads to responses from real employers. Ghost jobs, scam postings, and mislabeled "remote" positions that actually require office time don't count. By that standard, some heavily-marketed platforms underperform while others quietly deliver results.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #1f2937; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-size: 2rem;">What Makes These Boards Work</h2>

            <p>These 12 platforms share characteristics that translate into actual job offers rather than wasted applications.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Active, Real Job Postings</h3>

            <p>Ghost jobs—listings that aren't actually being filled—plague the job search market. <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and <strong>Indeed</strong> have ghost job problems due to their volume, but their sheer scale means plenty of real opportunities exist alongside the dead postings. <strong>We Work Remotely</strong> and <strong>FlexJobs</strong> have minimal ghost jobs because employers pay meaningful fees to post, creating incentive to remove filled positions.</p>

            <p><strong>Indeed</strong> has addressed this partially with their "actively hiring" badges and response rate indicators. <strong>Glassdoor</strong> shows application activity that hints at posting freshness. These signals help you prioritize likely-active listings.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Verified Employers</h3>

            <p>Scam jobs waste time at best and cause financial harm at worst. The platforms that work have mechanisms to verify employer legitimacy:</p>

            <ul style="margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 25px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>FlexJobs:</strong> Hand-screens every listing with a research team</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>We Work Remotely:</strong> $299+ posting fees deter scammers</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Remote OK:</strong> Employer-paid model with community reporting</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Hired:</strong> Vets both candidates and companies</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Company verification badges and established profiles</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Remote Job Assistant:</strong> Filters aggregated listings to remove suspicious postings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Functional Filtering</h3>

            <p>Remote job searching requires filtering that actually works. "Remote" on <strong>Indeed</strong> often includes hybrid or "remote until we change our minds" positions. <strong>We Work Remotely</strong> and <strong>Remote OK</strong> are remote-only by design—every listing is genuinely location-independent. <strong>FlexJobs</strong> verifies remote legitimacy as part of their screening.</p>

            <p><strong>LinkedIn's</strong> remote filter has improved significantly and now includes options for remote, hybrid, and on-site. <strong>Wellfound</strong> shows remote policies clearly in company profiles.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #1f2937; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-size: 2rem;">Platform Deep Dives</h2>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">LinkedIn — The Volume Leader</h3>

            <p><strong>LinkedIn</strong> has more remote job listings than any other platform. The professional network integration means you can research companies, find mutual connections for referrals, and understand team composition before applying. Easy Apply reduces friction for high-volume applications.</p>

            <p>The trade-off is noise. Ghost jobs, recruiter spam, and positions mislabeled as remote require active filtering. <strong>LinkedIn</strong> works best when you combine job searching with networking—the real power is using connections to get referrals, not just mass-applying.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> All industries, especially when you have existing network connections at target companies.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">We Work Remotely — The Curated Quality Standard</h3>

            <p><strong>We Work Remotely</strong> charges employers $299+ per listing, which fundamentally changes the quality equation. Companies paying that fee are serious about hiring and serious about remote work. The listings skew toward tech, product, design, and marketing roles at established remote-first companies.</p>

            <p>Volume is lower than <strong>LinkedIn</strong> or <strong>Indeed</strong>, but signal-to-noise ratio is exceptional. When a job appears on <strong>We Work Remotely</strong>, it's almost certainly real, actively hiring, and genuinely remote.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> Tech, product, design, and marketing professionals seeking remote-first companies with competitive salaries.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Indeed — The Accessible Workhorse</h3>

            <p><strong>Indeed</strong> aggregates jobs from across the internet, giving it unmatched reach. It's particularly strong for entry-level positions, customer service, administrative roles, and industries underrepresented on tech-focused boards. Company reviews and salary data help evaluate opportunities.</p>

            <p>The challenge is filtering. <strong>Indeed's</strong> volume includes ghost jobs, scams, and positions from companies you'd never want to work for. Use the salary filters, company ratings, and "actively hiring" indicators to focus on worthwhile opportunities.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> Entry-level seekers, non-tech industries, high-volume application strategies.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">FlexJobs — The Verified Option</h3>

            <p><strong>FlexJobs</strong> charges job seekers $9.95/month but hand-screens every listing. The subscription model means near-zero scams and curated quality. They verify that "remote" actually means remote and that companies are legitimate employers.</p>

            <p>The trade-off is paying for access to jobs that exist elsewhere for free. The value proposition works for people who want guaranteed legitimacy without doing their own verification, particularly in scam-heavy fields like customer service and data entry.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> Job seekers who prioritize verified listings, those in scam-heavy fields, people who value convenience over cost.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Remote OK — The Digital Nomad Favorite</h3>

            <p><strong>Remote OK</strong> built its reputation on salary transparency and location flexibility. Listings often include salary ranges upfront, and the platform explicitly supports asynchronous work arrangements and worldwide hiring. The employer-paid model keeps quality high.</p>

            <p>The focus is primarily tech and digital roles. If you're seeking customer service or traditional corporate positions, you'll find limited options here.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> Tech workers, digital nomads, those prioritizing salary transparency and async-friendly roles.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Wellfound (AngelList) — The Startup Specialist</h3>

            <p><strong>Wellfound</strong> dominates startup hiring. Equity compensation details appear upfront—you can see offered salary ranges and stock option packages before applying. Direct access to founders and small teams means shorter hiring processes at many companies.</p>

            <p>Startups carry inherent risk: lower stability, longer hours, and compensation partially tied to company success. But for those who want that environment, <strong>Wellfound</strong> is unmatched.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> People targeting startup roles, those interested in equity compensation, candidates who want direct access to hiring managers.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Remote Job Assistant — The Efficient Aggregator</h3>

            <p><strong>Remote Job Assistant</strong> aggregates listings from multiple sources with filtering to remove obvious junk. The value is efficiency—broad coverage without manually checking a dozen sites. Auto-apply features help with high-volume application strategies.</p>

            <p>As an aggregator, some listings may appear on multiple platforms. The curation removes obvious scams and ghost postings but isn't as thorough as hand-screening.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> Job seekers wanting broad coverage efficiently, those using high-volume application strategies, people comfortable with some self-verification.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Hired — The Reverse Marketplace</h3>

            <p><strong>Hired</strong> flips the traditional model: companies apply to you. You create a profile, and employers send interview requests with salary offers upfront. This works exceptionally well for in-demand technical talent but requires a strong profile to attract attention.</p>

            <p>The model doesn't work for everyone—if you're early-career or in a less-competitive field, you may get limited inbound interest. But for senior engineers, product managers, and other sought-after roles, <strong>Hired</strong> eliminates the application grind.</p>

            <p><strong>Works best for:</strong> Senior tech talent, those with in-demand skills, people who prefer inbound opportunities over outbound applications.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #1f2937; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-size: 2rem;">Best Platforms by Industry</h2>

            <p>Different industries cluster on different platforms. Using the right board for your field dramatically improves results.</p>

            <p>Set up job alerts on your chosen platforms rather than manually checking daily. Apply within 48 hours of new postings—early applicants receive more attention. Focus energy on customizing applications for strong-fit roles rather than mass-applying to everything.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #1f2937; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 25px; font-size: 2rem;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div style="margin: 30px 0;">
                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Which remote job boards actually get people hired?</h3>
                <p>The remote job boards with the best hiring track records are LinkedIn (highest volume, professional networking advantage), We Work Remotely (curated remote-first companies), Indeed (massive reach across industries), FlexJobs (verified scam-free listings), Remote OK (tech and digital focus), and Wellfound for startups. Success rates vary by industry—technical roles do best on We Work Remotely and LinkedIn, while customer service roles see more success on Indeed and FlexJobs. No single board dominates all fields.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What makes a remote job board "work" vs others?</h3>
                <p>Effective remote job boards share key traits: active job postings (not ghost jobs), legitimate employers (verified or fee-paying), relevant filtering options, reasonable application-to-interview ratios, and alignment with your industry. Boards "work" when they connect you with real opportunities efficiently. High-volume boards like LinkedIn work through numbers; curated boards like We Work Remotely work through quality. The best choice depends on your field and search strategy.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Are niche remote job boards better than general ones?</h3>
                <p>Niche boards often outperform general boards for specialized roles. We Work Remotely excels for tech. Dribbble dominates design hiring. Wellfound leads for startups. FlexJobs performs well for customer service and administrative roles. However, LinkedIn's volume makes it valuable across all fields. The practical approach: use 1-2 niche boards for your specialty plus LinkedIn for broad coverage. Don't limit yourself to one platform.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">How do I know if a remote job board is legitimate?</h3>
                <p>Legitimate remote job boards: have established reputations (years of operation, recognizable names), charge employers meaningful fees to post (filtering out scammers), show real company names with verifiable information, don't require payment from job seekers to apply (FlexJobs charges for access but not per-application), and have clear contact information and business registration. Avoid boards that seem to exist solely to collect your personal data or push you toward paid "services."</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Why do some remote job boards have so many ghost jobs?</h3>
                <p>Ghost jobs persist because: companies keep postings active for talent pipelines, recruiters maintain listings to build candidate databases, automated systems don't remove filled positions, and some postings exist for internal compliance rather than actual hiring. Free-to-post boards have more ghost jobs because there's no cost to leaving listings up. Employer-paid boards like We Work Remotely and curated boards like FlexJobs have fewer ghost jobs because maintaining fake listings costs money or manual effort.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">What is the best remote job board for tech workers?</h3>
                <p>For tech workers, the best remote job boards are We Work Remotely (remote-first tech companies, high salaries), LinkedIn (volume and recruiter access), Wellfound (startup equity opportunities), and Hired (companies apply to you). Stack-specific boards like Ruby Jobs or Go Jobs serve niche languages. Remote OK offers good tech coverage with salary transparency. Most senior tech workers find roles through LinkedIn recruiter outreach or referrals rather than active applications.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">How many remote job boards should I use?</h3>
                <p>Use 3-5 job boards strategically: one high-volume general board (LinkedIn or Indeed), one curated remote-specialist board (We Work Remotely, Remote OK, or FlexJobs), one niche board for your industry, and optionally an aggregator like Remote Job Assistant for broader coverage. More than 5 boards creates diminishing returns and scattered effort. Set up alerts on your chosen platforms rather than manually checking dozens of sites.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #374151; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Do remote job boards work for entry-level positions?</h3>
                <p>Remote job boards work for entry-level, but competition is fierce. Indeed and LinkedIn have the most entry-level remote listings. FlexJobs curates entry-level opportunities with verified employers. Customer service, sales, and support roles offer the most accessible entry points. Tech and professional roles are harder to land remotely without experience. For entry-level success: apply quickly (within 48 hours of posting), customize every application, and consider hybrid or contract roles to build remote experience.</p>

            <p>Remote job boards work when you use them strategically.

Use 3-4 strategically rather than spreading effort across a dozen. Quality applications on the right platforms beat mass applications everywhere.</p>
