                <h3>Q: How can I ensure a remote job is truly remote and not hybrid?</h3>
                <p><strong>A:</strong> Always check the job description for phrases like "remote-first," "work from anywhere," or "global remote." Be wary of listings that mention a specific city or state as the primary location, or use terms like "flexible remote" or "hybrid." Platforms like Remote Job Assistant specifically vet listings to ensure they are 100% remote.</p>
