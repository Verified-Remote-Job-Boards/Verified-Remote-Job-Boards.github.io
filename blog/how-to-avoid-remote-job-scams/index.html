                <h2>The Remote Work Revolution and the Rise of Scams</h2>
                <p>The shift to remote work has opened up incredible opportunities, but it has also created a fertile ground for sophisticated job scams. Scammers are exploiting the high demand for work-from-home positions, often posing as legitimate recruiters or companies to steal money, personal information, or both. Protecting yourself requires vigilance and a critical eye for red flags.</p>

                <h2>CRITICAL Red Flags: What to Watch Out For</h2>
                <p>Legitimate employers will never ask you to pay for a job. Any request for money is the single most important warning sign. Scammers have become adept at disguising these requests, but the core principle remains: <strong>never pay to get a job</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Your Safe Remote Job Search Strategy</h2>
                <p>To navigate the remote job market safely, adopt a proactive and skeptical approach:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Verify the Company:</strong> Do not rely on the email or job posting alone. Search for the company on LinkedIn, check their official website, and look for news articles or reviews. A legitimate company will have a professional, established online presence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Trusted Job Boards:</strong> Stick to reputable, verified job boards that actively screen for scams. These platforms often have dedicated teams to vet employers and listings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check the Domain:</strong> Before clicking any links or replying to emails, carefully inspect the sender's email address and the website URL. Scammers often use "spoofed" or slightly altered domains (e.g., <code>amazonn.com</code> instead of <code>amazon.com</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If a job offer seems too easy, the salary is unusually high for the role, or the process is rushed, it is likely a scam. A legitimate hiring process takes time and involves multiple steps.</li>
                </ol>

                        <p class="review-text">It's okay, I guess. The site has a lot of listings, but I still had to do a lot of my own vetting. I reported two that looked suspicious, and they were taken down pretty fast, so that's a plus. Just wish the filtering was a little better to save me some time.</p>

The third one was a dead link. I know it's hard to keep up with scammers, but I expected a higher level of verification for a site focused on 'verified' jobs.</p>
