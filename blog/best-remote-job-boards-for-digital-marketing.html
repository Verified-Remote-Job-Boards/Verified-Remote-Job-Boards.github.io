                          <p class="review-text">Honestly, I was disappointed. I applied to about 15 jobs in the marketing category and heard back from zero. It feels like a lot of the listings are old or just posted for compliance. I've had much better luck on smaller, more focused boards.</p>

                          <p class="review-text">I paid for a premium alert service thinking I'd get early access to great jobs, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The free site is just as good, which is fine, but don't bother with the paid features if you're expecting a huge advantage.</p>

                    <h3>5. MarketingHire</h3>
                    <p>A niche job board focused exclusively on marketing, advertising, and PR roles. While it lists both remote and in-office jobs, its dedicated focus makes it excellent for finding specialized digital marketing positions.</p>

                          <p class="review-text">Great for finding marketing jobs, but you have to filter carefully for "remote." A lot of the listings are hybrid or in-office, which is annoying when you're only looking for WFH. Once you filter, though, the quality of the remote listings is very high.</p>

                          <p class="review-text">It's a solid niche board. The main drawback is that the site design feels a bit dated, and the search function isn't as snappy as the bigger platforms. But if you're patient, you'll find roles here that aren't posted anywhere else.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: What is the difference between a general and a niche remote job board?</h4>
                        <p class="faq-answer">A: General remote job boards (like We Work Remotely) list jobs across all industries, offering high volume but requiring more filtering. Niche job boards (like Remote Job Assistant or MarketingHire) focus on a specific industry, such as digital marketing, offering fewer but more highly relevant and curated listings.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: Should I pay for a premium remote job board membership?</h4>
                        <p class="faq-answer">A: It depends on your situation. Premium boards often offer features like early access to listings, better filtering, or vetted companies (like FlexJobs). However, many excellent jobs are available on free boards. Start with the free options and only consider paying if you find the premium features offer a significant time-saving or competitive advantage in your specific job search.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: How can I make my application stand out for a remote digital marketing role?</h4>
                        <p class="faq-answer">A: Remote roles are highly competitive. To stand out, tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific job description, emphasizing remote-specific skills like asynchronous communication, self-management, and proficiency with remote collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Asana). Always include a portfolio showcasing measurable results (e.g., "Increased organic traffic by 40%").</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: Are remote digital marketing jobs truly "work from anywhere"?</h4>
                        <p class="faq-answer">A: Not always. Many companies have legal or tax restrictions that limit hiring to specific countries, states, or time zones. Always check the job description for location requirements (e.g., "US only," "EU time zones"). Boards like Remote Job Assistant often clarify these restrictions upfront.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">A: Currently, high-demand skills include SEO and Content Strategy (especially for B2B SaaS), Performance Marketing (PPC, paid social with strong ROI tracking), Marketing Automation (HubSpot, Marketo), and Data Analytics (using tools like Google Analytics 4 and Tableau to inform strategy).</p>
