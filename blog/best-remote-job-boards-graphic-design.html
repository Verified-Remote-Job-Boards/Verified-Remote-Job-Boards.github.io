                              <p class="review-text">It's okay, but it feels like a lot of the remote jobs are for senior-level roles. As a mid-level designer, I find myself scrolling past a lot of things I'm not qualified for yet. The quality is high, but the volume for my experience level is low.</p>

                        <p>Part of the Adobe family, Behance is another cornerstone of the design world. Its job board is a reliable source for both full-time and freelance remote graphic design positions. The sheer volume of users and the integration with Adobe Creative Cloud make it a natural hub for creative job seekers.</p>

                              <p class="review-text">AIGA is where you go for the really high-level, established design roles. I found a remote Art Director position here. It's not a huge volume of jobs, but the ones that are there are usually very serious and well-paid. You need to be a member to get the most out of it, though.</p>

                              <p class="review-text">Too US-centric for me. I'm looking for remote work from Canada, and almost all the listings require you to be based in the States or have US work authorization. If you're in the US, it's probably great, but for international remote, it's not the best.</p>

                              <p class="review-text">The jobs are high quality, but the site itself is a bit clunky and dated. It's not as easy to filter for 'remote only' as I'd like, and the search function could be better. I still check it because of the caliber of the companies, but it's not the most user-friendly experience.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: What is the difference between a general job board and a niche design job board?</h4>
                        <p>A: General job boards (like Indeed or LinkedIn) list millions of jobs across all industries, requiring extensive filtering to find relevant design roles. Niche design job boards (like Dribbble or Behance) are curated specifically for creative professionals, meaning a much higher percentage of the listings are relevant to graphic design, UX/UI, and related fields. This saves time and often leads to higher-quality opportunities.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: Do I need a portfolio to apply for remote graphic design jobs?</h4>
                        <p>A: Yes, a strong, up-to-date portfolio is absolutely essential. For graphic design, your portfolio is your resume. Platforms like Dribbble and Behance are especially valuable because they are portfolio-centric, allowing you to link your work directly to your application, which is what hiring managers prioritize.</p>

                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: Are "remote" jobs always location-independent?</h4>
                        <p>A: Not always. While some remote jobs are truly "work from anywhere" (location-independent), many are "remote-hybrid" or "remote-local," meaning they require you to live in a specific country, state, or time zone for legal, tax, or operational reasons. Always check the job description for location restrictions. Boards like NoDesk specialize in truly remote-first roles.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4 class="faq-question">Q: How often should I check these job boards?</h4>
                        <p>A: For the best results, you should check the niche boards (Dribbble, NoDesk) daily, as the best jobs are often filled quickly. For professional organizations like AIGA, a weekly check is usually sufficient. Using a personalized job assistant tool, like Remote Job Assistant, can automate this process by sending you alerts for new listings.</p>
