                    <p>One of the largest and oldest remote job boards, We Work Remotely (WWR) is a massive resource. The "Programming" section is robust, offering everything from front-end to DevOps roles. The sheer volume of listings is its main strength.</p>

                <div class="star-rating">★★★★★</div>
                <p class="review-text">Seriously, the best board I've used in years. I was tired of seeing "remote" jobs that were actually hybrid. RJA's listings are genuinely 100% remote, and the salary transparency is a huge time-saver. Landed a great role in two weeks.</p>

                <p class="review-text">I appreciate the quality over quantity approach. Every job I clicked on was relevant to my skill set (backend Python/Go). The application process was smooth, and I got three interview requests within a week. Highly recommend for experienced devs.</p>

                <p class="review-text">I've been using this platform for about 3 months now and found two great opportunities. The quality of listings is definitely higher than other boards I've tried. Response rates from companies seem better too.</p>

                <p class="review-text">It's fine, but you have to wade through a lot of noise. There are a ton of listings, which is good, but the filtering isn't as precise as I'd like. I wish more of the postings included salary ranges upfront. Still, a must-check site.</p>

                <p class="review-text">Super easy to use. I like the "Digital Nomad" vibe of the site, and I found a few interesting roles that weren't on the bigger boards. The email alerts are actually useful and not spammy.</p>

                <p class="review-text">The screening process was intense, but it was worth it. The clients are top-tier, and the rates are fantastic. It's a completely different experience than applying to jobs—they match you with projects. Highly recommend if you can pass the tests.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the best remote job board for entry-level software engineers?</h3>
                <p>While many boards focus on experienced talent, <strong>We Work Remotely</strong> often has a good selection of entry-level and junior roles, as its high volume of listings includes a wider range of company sizes and needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I use a niche board like Toptal or a general one like Remote OK?</h3>
                <p>It depends on your experience and goals. If you are a highly experienced engineer seeking premium freelance contracts, <strong>Toptal</strong> is ideal. For a broader search across various full-time and contract roles, a general board like <strong>Remote OK</strong> or <strong>Remote Job Assistant</strong> is better.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How often should I check the job boards?</h3>
                <p>New remote jobs are posted daily. For the best results, check your preferred boards at least <strong>three times a week</strong>, ideally in the morning, as new listings often receive the most attention early on.</p>
