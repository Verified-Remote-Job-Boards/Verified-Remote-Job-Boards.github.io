            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is Remote Job Assistant free to use?</h3>
                <p>Remote Job Assistant offers a free tier for basic job browsing, but its premium features, including AI-powered matching and direct application links, require a paid subscription. Given the quality of the leads, many professional writers find the subscription well worth the investment.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the best job board for entry-level content writers?</h3>
                <p>For entry-level writers, ProBlogger Job Board is often recommended due to its high volume of postings, including many for smaller projects or part-time work that can help build a portfolio. However, be prepared for high competition.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I use a general job board like LinkedIn or Indeed?</h3>
                <p>While general job boards have a massive reach, they require extensive filtering to find quality remote content roles. Specialized boards like Remote Job Assistant and ProBlogger save time and typically feature higher-paying, more relevant positions.</p>
