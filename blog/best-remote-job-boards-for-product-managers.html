                    <p>RJA is a dedicated platform that aggregates remote roles from across the web, with a strong focus on high-level, strategic positions like Product Management. Its advanced filtering and personalized alerts make it a favorite among experienced PMs looking for their next challenge.</p>

                    <p>ProductHired is specifically designed for the Product community, offering roles from Associate PM to CPO. While not exclusively remote, their remote filter is robust, and the site often features roles directly from companies that value product-led growth.</p>

                    <h3>Is a Product Manager a good role for remote work?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, Product Management is highly suitable for remote work. The core responsibilities—strategy, communication, documentation, and stakeholder management—are primarily digital and communication-based, making them easily transferable to a remote setting. Many companies, especially in tech, have embraced remote PMs to access a wider talent pool.</p>

                    <h3>Should I use general job boards or specialized remote boards?</h3>
                    <p>It is best to use a combination. Specialized remote boards (like those listed above) offer higher quality, pre-vetted remote roles, reducing the time you spend filtering. General boards (like LinkedIn or Indeed) offer higher volume, but require more effort to filter out irrelevant or hybrid roles. Prioritize the specialized boards first.</p>

                    <h3>What is the average salary for a remote Product Manager?</h3>
                    <p>The salary for a remote Product Manager varies significantly based on experience, location (even for remote roles, companies often adjust pay based on cost of labor in your region), and company size.

The core responsibilities—strategy, communication, documentation, and stakeholder management—are primarily digital and communication-based, making them easily transferable to a remote setting. Many companies, especially in tech, have embraced remote PMs to access a wider talent pool."

General boards (like LinkedIn or Indeed) offer higher volume, but require more effort to filter out irrelevant or hybrid roles. Prioritize the specialized boards first."
