                <h3>What is the difference between a graphic designer and a UI/UX designer?</h3>
                <p>A <strong>graphic designer</strong> typically focuses on static visual assets like logos, branding, print materials, and illustrations. A <strong>UI/UX designer</strong> focuses on the user experience (UX) and the visual interface (UI) of digital products like websites and apps. In the remote market, UI/UX roles are often more abundant and higher-paying, but graphic design roles remain strong in marketing and content creation.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need a portfolio to apply for remote graphic design jobs?</h3>
                <p><strong>Absolutely.</strong> A portfolio is non-negotiable for any design role. For remote work, a high-quality, easily navigable online portfolio (on Behance, Dribbble, or a personal website) is even more critical. Ensure your portfolio showcases a variety of projects and clearly explains your design process.</p>

                <h3>How do I determine a fair remote salary or freelance rate?</h3>
                <p>Remote salaries vary based on the company's location, your experience, and specialization. Use tools like Glassdoor, Payscale, and remote salary aggregators for benchmarks. For freelance work, calculate your desired annual salary, divide by billable hours, and add a buffer for taxes and overhead.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Are remote graphic design jobs mostly freelance or full-time?</h3>
                <p>The market is a healthy mix. <strong>Freelance</strong> opportunities are abundant on platforms like Upwork, offering flexibility. <strong>Full-time</strong> remote roles are also common with tech companies, agencies, and large corporations. Your choice depends on your preference for stability versus variety and autonomy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What software skills are most in demand for remote graphic designers?</h3>
                <p>Proficiency in the <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong> (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) remains foundational. Skills in <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Sketch</strong> are increasingly in demand for UI/UX roles. Knowledge of motion graphics software (After Effects) and 3D tools is a significant advantage.</p>
