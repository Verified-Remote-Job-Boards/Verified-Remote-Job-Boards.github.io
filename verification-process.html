            <h2>Why Verification Matters</h2>
            <p>The remote job market is booming, but so is the number of scams, outdated listings, and "remote" jobs that require you to live in a specific city. Our process is designed to cut through the noise, providing you with a curated list of job boards you can trust. We don't just check if a website exists; we dive deep into their practices, data integrity, and user experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The 5-Step Verification Protocol</h2>
            <p>Every job board must pass the following five critical checks to earn our "Verified" badge:</p>

            <div class="verification-steps">
                <article>
                    <h3>1. Data Integrity and Freshness Check</h3>
                    <p>We use automated tools and manual checks to ensure the job board's listings are current. We look for signs of stale data, duplicate posts, and generic, non-specific job descriptions. A high percentage of recently posted, unique jobs is mandatory.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>2. True Remote-First Vetting</h3>
                    <p>This is the most critical step. We verify that the companies and jobs listed are genuinely remote, not "remote-local" or hybrid roles disguised as fully remote. We examine the board's policies on geographic restrictions and interview companies about their remote work culture.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>3. Company and Employer Legitimacy</h3>
                    <p>We cross-reference the employers listed on the board with public business registries, LinkedIn profiles, and news sources. This step weeds out shell companies, multi-level marketing schemes, and outright scams. We prioritize boards that feature established, reputable companies.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>4. User Experience and Transparency</h3>
                    <p>A great job board is easy to use. We evaluate the site's navigation, search functionality, and overall design. Crucially, we check for transparency regarding pricing (if any), data usage, and clear contact information for support.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>5. Community Feedback and Reputation</h3>
                    <p>We monitor public forums, social media, and direct user submissions to gauge the board's reputation. Consistent negative feedback, especially concerning scams or poor support, leads to immediate review and potential de-verification.</p>

                <p class="review-text">I was skeptical at first, but the quality of the job listings here is genuinely impressive. I've wasted so much time on other sites with outdated or fake posts. This verification process really works. Found my new role in under a month!</p>

                <div class="star-rating">★★★★☆</div>
                <p class="review-text">It's a solid platform. The jobs are real, which is the main thing. I wish there were more filtering options for specific time zones, but overall, the experience is much better than the big general job sites. The verification badge gives me peace of mind.</p>

                <p class="review-text">The verification process is a great idea, and it definitely cuts down on spam. However, I've noticed a few listings that are technically remote but require you to be in a very specific, small area. Maybe the location check could be a bit stricter on 'fully remote' vs 'remote-local' listings. Still a good resource, though.</p>

                <p class="review-text">I appreciate the effort to verify, but I applied to three jobs marked as 'verified' and two of the companies never responded, and the third told me the position was already filled a week ago. The verification seems to focus more on the company being real than the job post being current. Needs improvement on listing freshness.</p>
